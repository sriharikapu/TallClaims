# TallClaims

TallClaims Set a bounty on your Research Paper and reward the best research Enthusiasts.

# Inspiration


# What it does

TallClaims allows a Anyone to publish their Research Paper/Idea in Blockchain and user to issue a bounty that will serve as a monetary reward (paid in cryptocurrency) for the researcher(s) who provide the most helpful researchs to a particular paper/topic.

# How we built it

We created a short list of tasks that would comprise the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) within the available time window over the 30-hour hackathon (ETHIndia). We used Node.js with Solidity and IPFS to create the back-end for the application, and HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create the front-end.

# Challenges we ran into

We ran into difficulties with integrating code from different components, as most of the team members were new to Ethereum and blockchain development. We also encountered challenges in narrowing down the use cases (user research stories finally limited only to big organizations) to fit within the development timeframe available, and in thinking about algorithm for smart contracts.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to brainstorm many use cases around the possibility of usecases of blockchains and cryptocurrencies. In the end, we were proud to address a real problem that, if solved, would help to decentralize online peer review platform and better reward those who are able to contribute their knowledge in improving the existing research paper and towards educating their peers.

We were also proud of being able to build a simple MVP demonstrating the use of smart contracts for this goal (already made available by standard bounty networks), as well as envisioning the future possibilities of this application and how it could be further applied in other scenarios

# What we learned

We learned more about how bounty networks operate, as well as how to execute a smart contract using Web3, the platform for decentralized apps (Dapps). We also learned how to use IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for storing data in the blockchain.

# What's next for TallClaims

Since we completed approximately 50% of the MVP that was targeted for the weekend, the next step for TallClaims would be to continue and finish building a functional prototype application, to better demonstrate the concept and prove that it could be a valuable asset to the research community.
